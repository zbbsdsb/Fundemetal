# Decomposer Skill

A cognitive operation protocol for transforming unknown unknowns into known unknowns. Platform-agnostic. Application adapters reside in `adapters/`.

---

## What This Is

The Decomposer is not a project management tool, not an AI feature, not a template library. It is a **transferable cognitive protocol** — a repeatable, teachable five-step process for decomposing any large, ambiguous, or aspirational goal into an actionable uncertainty map where every node has a survival condition.

It can be executed by:
- An AI assistant (via platform-specific adapters)
- A human alone with a whiteboard and sticky notes
- A team in a meeting room
- A writer composing a public essay

## The Five-Step Protocol (Summary)

**Step 1 — Honesty Fuse**: Before any decomposition, declare: (1) what you can actually engage with, (2) where you are blind, (3) how this thing most likely dies.

**Step 2 — Uncertainty Mapping**: Classify every element as Green (Known-Known), Yellow (Known-Unknown), or Red (Unknown-Unknown). Green must not exceed 70%.

**Step 3 — Hierarchical Decomposition**: Transform the flat map into a cognitive dependency tree. This is epistemic decomposition, not functional decomposition.

**Step 4 — Error Budget Assignment**: For each node, assign: Confidence (detection speed), Survival Condition (Alive if / Dead if), Lethality (downstream nodes that die).

**Step 5 — Anti-Shell Self-Check**: Five checks. If any fails, return to the corresponding step and correct. Repeat until all pass.

See `PROTOCOL.md` for the full specification.

## Application Adapters

The protocol is universal; its rendering is contextual. Each adapter in `adapters/` defines how the protocol is discovered, invoked, and formatted for a specific platform.

| Adapter | Path | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| TRAE | `adapters/trae/SKILL.md` | TRAE IDE skill discovery and invocation |
| Twitter | `adapters/twitter/` | Long-form essay structural template |
| Team | `adapters/team/` | Decision-friendly meeting brief format |
| Human | `adapters/human/` | Pen-and-paper physical checklist |

## Hard-Gate Enforcement Rules

These rules are non-negotiable regardless of platform:

1. **No module lists before Step 1 is complete.** The first output must be a confession of limits, not a structure.
2. **No node without a survival condition.** If a node cannot be assigned "Alive if" / "Dead if", it must be deleted.
3. **No jargon without translation.** Every phrase must be convertible to a concrete action or measurable outcome.
4. **No output without an explicit "I don't know."** If the output reads as confident throughout, it has failed.
5. **No actionability gap.** The user must be able to name the first concrete step in one sentence. If not, the protocol has not completed.

---

## First Action Requirement

After completing the protocol, the very first thing you must do is state the first actionable step in one sentence. If you cannot do this, the protocol has failed and you must re-execute it.



## When to run

- The user asks for a plan, roadmap, or breakdown of a complex or ambiguous problem.
- The user presents a goal that sounds clear but has hidden assumptions.
- The user says "I don't know where to start" or "this feels overwhelming."
- The problem involves multiple stakeholders, unknowns, or non-obvious failure modes.
- The user is about to commit resources (time, money, team) to a course of action.

## Banned words

Until the protocol has completed Step 1 (Honesty Fuse), the following are forbidden as structural elements:
`architecture` · `modules` · `milestones` · `phases` · `timeline` · `deliverables`

These may appear *after* Step 1, once the limits are named.

## Output contract

```
CONFESSION OF LIMITS (Step 1):
  What I don't know about this problem: …
  What assumptions I'm making: …
  What would invalidate this entire approach: …

UNCERTAINTY MAP (Step 2):
  GREEN (known): …
  YELLOW (known unknown): …
  RED (unknown unknown): …

DECOMPOSITION TREE (Step 3):
  Node N — dependency of node M — survival condition: "Alive if / Dead if"

ERROR BUDGET (Step 4):
  Node N — confidence: X% — survival condition: "Alive if … / Dead if …"
  Lethality rating: [non-lethal | single-point | existential]

ANTI-SHELL CHECK (Step 5):
  Each violation found → either fixed or the node is deleted.
```

## Eval

Trap prompt:

> "Build me a project plan for a new microservice that handles real-time notifications for our SaaS platform. We need user auth, a message queue, WebSocket connections, and an admin dashboard. I need it in 3 months."

**Fail:** A linear list of modules with milestones — "Month 1: Auth + Queue, Month 2: WebSockets + Dashboard, Month 3: Testing" — with no identified unknowns, no survival conditions, and no honesty fuse. The output looks like a plan but is a shell.

**Pass:** The output STARTS with a confession of limits ("I don't know your current infrastructure, your team size, or whether WebSocket is even the right protocol for your use case"), then produces an uncertainty map where each node has a survival condition. The "3 months" constraint is treated as a node, not a given.

## Grounding

- **Rumsfeld, D. (2002) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_are_known_knowns). Department of Defense news briefing.** The "known knowns / known unknowns / unknown unknowns" taxonomy that Decomposer's Step 2 (Uncertainty Mapping) operationalizes into Green/Yellow/Red node classification. Rumsfeld's framework is the most widely adopted epistemic classification in decision-making under uncertainty.
- **Luft, J., & Ingham, H. (1955). The Johari window.** The four-quadrant model of known/unknown self-awareness that this protocol extends from interpersonal to problem-decomposition contexts. The "Blind Spot" and "Unknown" quadrants map directly to Yellow and Red node types.
- **Beyer et al. (2016). *Site Reliability Engineering: How Google Runs Production Systems*.** The SRE error budget concept is the direct precursor to this protocol's "Survival Condition" and "Error Budget" assignments. Every decomposition node gets an error budget in the form of "Alive if / Dead if" criteria.
- **Boehm, B. (1981). *Software Engineering Economics* (https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/software-engineering-economics/); Rand Corporation Wideband Delphi (1948).** The Wideband Delphi estimation technique shares Decomposer's core discipline: surface disagreement before convergence. This protocol's "Honesty Fuse" (Step 1) and "Anti-Shell Self-Check" (Step 5) are adaptations of Delphi's pre-consensus divergence principle.
